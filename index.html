            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, marinate chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili, biryani masala, salt, and half of the mint and coriander leaves. Let it sit for at least 30 minutes (or longer, refrigerated).</li>
                <li>Heat oil/ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add whole spices and saut√© until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add sliced onions and fry until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies, cook until tomatoes soften.</li>
                <li>Add the marinated chicken and cook on medium-high heat for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chicken is half-cooked and releases oil.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, boil water in another pot. Add salt and a few drops of oil. Add the soaked basmati rice and cook until 70% done (al dente). Drain the rice immediately.</li>
                <li>Layering: In the pot with the chicken, spread half of the partially cooked rice evenly over the chicken.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle remaining mint and coriander leaves, and half of the saffron milk (if using) over the rice.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining rice layer. Sprinkle remaining saffron milk and fried onions (if using) on top.</li>
                <li>Cover the pot tightly with a lid (you can use dough to seal the edges for dum cooking).</li>
                <li>Cook on low heat for 15-20 minutes (dum cooking) until rice is fully cooked and flavors are absorbed.</li>
                <li>Gently mix the biryani before serving. Serve hot with raita.</li>
                </ol>
